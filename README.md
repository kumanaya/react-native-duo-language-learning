## Tech

Duo uses a number of projects to work properly:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - Create apps for Android and iOS using React
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript,
- [Firebase](https://https://firebase.google.com/) - Firestore to get data in cloud

## Firebase

- Create firebase project into firebase console.
- Add. web app and (IOS & Android), save all files into respective location.
- Copy the web firebase config and add. into firebase.js file.
Example:
```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: '<apiKey>',
  authDomain: '<authDomain>',
  projectId: '<projectId>',
  storageBucket: '<storageBucket>',
  messagingSenderId: '<messagingSenderId>',
  appId: '<appId>',
};
```

## Firebase Store
- Example of questions structure:
[colection] questions > [documents] ids > [fields] docs

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "phraseEnglish": "Coffee and milk",
  "phraseGerman": "Kaffee und milch",
  "answerEnglish": "milk",
  "wordsEnglish": ["coffee", "and", "milk", "please"],
